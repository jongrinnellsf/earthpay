# ðŸŒŽ EarthPay

EarthPay is a simple, secure payment application that allows verified users with EarthPass NFTs to send money anywhere in the world for free. It's a DEMO app, defaulting to use Base L2, but can use any chain supported by ScaffoldAlchemy, which this project is entirely built off of!

## Features

- **Secure Payments**: Only verified EarthPass NFT holders can send and receive payments
- **Zero Fees**: Send money globally without transaction fees
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with visual representations of transactions
- **Transaction History**: View your recent payment activity
- **Simple Verification**: Get verified easily with an EarthPass NFT

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts (ERC-20 token & ERC-721 NFT)
- **Authentication**: Account Kit by Alchemy
- **Network**: Deployed on Base Sepolia testnet
